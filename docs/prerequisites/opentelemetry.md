OpenTelemetry is a set of open-source tools and APIs for collecting, processing, and exporting telemetry data from cloud-native applications. It was created by merging the OpenTracing and OpenCensus projects and is now a graduated project of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).

With OpenTelemetry, developers and operators can gain insight into their applications' performance, reliability, and behavior, and use this information to optimize and troubleshoot their systems.

## Features

OpenTelemetry provides a rich set of features to help you collect and analyze telemetry data from your applications:

### Instrumentation

OpenTelemetry provides a variety of instrumentation libraries for popular programming languages such as Java, Python, and Go. These libraries can be used to automatically collect telemetry data from your applications without requiring any code changes.

Instrumentation includes tracing, metrics, and logging. OpenTelemetry provides flexible APIs that allow you to customize your telemetry data collection to fit your specific needs.

### Data Collection

OpenTelemetry supports various data collectors for receiving telemetry data from your applications. These collectors can be used to aggregate and process telemetry data before exporting it to downstream systems.

Collectors include agents, exporters, and receivers. OpenTelemetry also provides integrations with popular telemetry data stores such as Prometheus, Jaeger, and Zipkin.

### Export

OpenTelemetry supports a variety of exporters for exporting telemetry data to downstream systems. These exporters include services such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Azure.

In addition, OpenTelemetry provides its own exporter called the OpenTelemetry Collector. The collector is a flexible and powerful tool that can be used to aggregate, process, and export telemetry data to multiple destinations simultaneously.

### Open-Source

OpenTelemetry is fully open-source and provides a vendor-neutral, community-driven approach to telemetry data collection. It is designed to be flexible and customizable, allowing developers and operators to build and extend their telemetry data collection workflows as needed.

OpenTelemetry is also vendor-agnostic, meaning that it can be used with any cloud provider, container orchestration system, or other infrastructure technology.
